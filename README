GetBummer.com, code name fuckthat, is a Ruby on Rails + Backbone web
based application to give users who install the companion Chrome
plug-in the ability to "dislike" content posted on Facebook by saying
it is a "bummer."

When the user clicks "Bummer", the web service on getbummer.com gets
pinged, and a record of the "bum" is kept in a database. Additionally,
the web service uses a FB API to add a new story to the user's
newsfeed.

The web service is in two parts:

1. web -- the web server which handles client browser requests,
   creates HTML pages and serves Javascript resources.

2. core -- the API server which the web server uses to update the
   database, etc.

To run getbummer.com, you need to run two different web servers on
different ports. The sb-tools is used to configure this, and has
convenience scripts to start and stop the servers.
